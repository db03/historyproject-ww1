    <h2>First used by: the Allies</h2>
    <p>This is more a mixture of a number of toxic gases and was deployed via shells into enemy lines. It could be fatal in adequate concentrations but if there wasn't enough, it would cause only mild effects that merely incapacitated the enemy and left no permanent damage.</p>
    <h3>Hydrogen cyanide</h3>
    <p>Hydrogen cyanide is one of the gases that was added. It's powerful enough to be used as an effective gas by itself, being extremely toxic and colourless but a fatal flaw meant it couldn't be deployed effectively. When the French tested it in 1916, it wouldn't work well because of weather conditions. Since Hydrogen cyanide is lighter than air, it rose in the air and it didn't hurt the enemy.</p>
    <h3>Arsenic Trichloride</h3>
    <p>Arsenic's in the name. It's another very poisonous gas.</p>
    <h3>Chloroform</h3>
    <p>Chloroform is probably one of the most famous gases for its use it crime shows and sometimes even comedies. Originally used as an anaesthetic, it could easily kill someone if they weren't given the right dosage and caused a few deaths of patients before a consistent method of calculating the correct amount to administer was created.</p>
    <h3>Stannic Chloride</h3>
    <p>You can read about Stannic Chloride <a href="stannic-chloride">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>Cyanogen Bromide</h3>
    <p>Cyanogen Bromide is another extremely flammable and poisonous gas that was used only in the Austrian version of the mixture of gases.</p>
    <h3>Effects of Cyanogen Compounds:</h3>
    <p>In low concentrations, it can make the victim weaker and causes dizzines, headaches and lung pain but would leave <b>no permanent damage</b>. In still quite a lot concentration, it can kill.</p>
