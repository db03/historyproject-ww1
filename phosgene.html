    <h1 class="gastitle">Phosgene</h1>
    <h2>First used by: the Central Powers (Germany) or the Allies (France)</h2>
    <p>This gas was most likely used in Ypres by the Germans in December 1915. Some sources differ from this and state that the first to use this gas was the French. It was a very toxic gas which could easily kill - made worse by the fact that it is hard to detect. It was reported to have a hay-like smell but only had an odour at a concentration that wasn't even needed for lethal effects. It also was colourless - meaning that often people were severely affected by it before they were alerted they needed a gas mask. However, the gas often needed ~48 hours before it would kill soldiers since it has to build up in the lungs. The Germans replaced chlorine with phosgene as it was more effective. Overall, it's estimated that ~85% of the ~91,000 deaths attributed to gas were caused by phosgene.</p>
    <h3>   Effects of tear gas:</h3>
    <p>Immediate effects are coughing, irritation to the respiratory tract and to the eyes. When there is enough in the lungs, it can cause death.</p>
