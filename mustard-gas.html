    <h1 class="gastitle">Mustard Gas</h1>
    <h2>First used by: the Central Powers (Germany)</h2>
    <p>One of the most famous gases used in the war. This gas earned the title of a weapon of mass destruction for killing 100,000 soldiers and civilians and injuring 1,000,000 over the entire war. The Allies nicknamed it "Hot Stuff", shortened to "H.S." and then dropped the "S" to just make it "H". The thing that made it so effective was that it was hard to detect: the gas could stay on no man's land for up to two weeks so soldiers would think they wouldn't be affected by it after a bit. You also may not feel any effects until it's fatal. This was made even worse by the fact that when the gas was first used, it got past the gas masks.</p>
    <h3>Effects of Mustard Gas:</h3>
    <p>Strong blistering effects and skin irritation. Sometimes death.</p>
