    <h1>Tear Gas</h1>
    <br></br>
    <h2>First used by: the French</h2>
    <br></br>
    <p>This gas, deployed first by the French in August 1914, was used originally as an attempt to stop the powerful German advance. The small amount of gas deployed meant that it wasn't intended to kill but instead maim the enemy so they could not go on fighting. It's still used today by police in aggressive riots. The French consumed most of their supplies quite quickly, so they had to produce more after a new order was made. Tear gas is made out of xylyl bromide, and as the French didn't have a great supply of bromine, they started producing it differently, changing its main ingredient to chloroacetone.</p>
