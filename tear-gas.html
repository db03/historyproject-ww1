    <h1 class="gastitle">Tear Gas</h1>
    <h2>First used by: the French</h2>
    <p>This gas, some think first deployed first by the French in August 1914, was used originally as an attempt to stop the powerful German advance. The small amount of gas deployed meant that it wasn't intended to kill but instead maim the enemy so they could not go on fighting. It's still used today by police in aggressive riots. The French consumed most of their supplies quite quickly, so they had to produce more after a new order was made. Tear gas is made out of xylyl bromide, and as the French didn't have a great supply of bromine, they started producing it differently, changing its main ingredient to chloroacetone. Some think that tear gas was not used as early as this and instead was first used by the Germans in 1915 in the Battle of Bolim√≥w against the Russians where they fired 18,000 "T-shells". The Germans famouly used it also at the battle of Neuve Chapelle. The British were so angry at their use of chemical weapons and considered it babaric. This was probably only for propaganda since the British started using chemical weapons themselves soon after.</p>
    <h3>   Effects of tear gas:</h3>
    <p>Tear gas irritates the eyes, mouth, lungs and nose. The effects usually start after around 30 seconds. It caused a difficulty breathing and pain in the chest.</p>
