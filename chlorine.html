    <h2>First used by: the Germans</h2>
    <p>This gas was the first to be used that killed people when the Germans deployed it across trenches. The gas itself was a by-product of dye production from some major companies, so those companies started working with Fritz Haber (a notable German chemist) to work out how to use this gas in warfare across no man's land. The Germans had deployed 168 tons of the gas in an area north of Ypres by 22 April 1915 and it was very effective, confusing and hurting the enemy much to the dismay of the Triple Entente. The Triple Entente claimed that the use of chlorine gas was a violation of international law but the Germans argued that they only had banned chemical shells and not gas projectors. The Germans continued to use the gas in gas cannisters throughout the war.</p>
