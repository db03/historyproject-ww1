    <h2>First used by: the Germans</h2>
    <p>This gas was first used in March 1915 and was used to disrupt and harass enemies nearby by being an eye irritant. Without wearing a mask, a soldier wouldn't be able to continue at all. It was described once by a WW1 veteran like this: "This [...] gas made my eyes water. You couldn't stop crying - water was running from your eyes... The gas is still with me today."</p>
    <h3>   Effects of Benzyl Bromide:</h3>
    <p>Severe eye irritation. Benzyl Bromide is classed as a lachrymator, which means it damages the corneas and feels much like your eyes being hit by something. In extreme cases where there is a lot of exposure to the gas, respiratory systems can be shut down (this, however, is very rare).</p>
